Text message I don't know the number
Flexin' on these niggas, every bone and muscle
Steady taking shots, but I'm never hurting nothing
Even then you don't worry none

And I'd like to give a shoutout to my niggas with the game plan
And shoutout to my niggas with escape plans
Twenty bands, rain dance
We can keep the rain check or we can make plans
